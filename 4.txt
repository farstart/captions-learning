All right in this one we have a yellow circle inside I guess a mauve you might call this color

mauve backdrop and our goal is for this circle to sit in the very middle of the space both in

horizontal and vertical directions so I don't really have a container right once again there

are some baseline styles we have the body tag it feels a little funny to me to start putting

flexbox stuff on the body so I'm going to start by saying let's add a wrapper to this one

next let's start styling that wrapper so we can start the same way as we did last time display

flex and we're going to hit a problem but I want to hit it by following what might be a reasonable

intuition which is if I want to center things horizontally right it's still again a flex row

so horizontally would be centering it along the primary axis so I can use justify content center

that works just fine and then for the other axis you would use align items center

you'll notice it doesn't work and we can figure out why it doesn't work by poking at this in the

dev tools and what we discover is that our wrapper is only 40 pixels tall because we can only center

something within a container and this container is following all the same rules of flow layout

that's why I mentioned that when you set display flex you're changing the rendering the layout

mode of the children but you're not changing the layout mode of the parent so we have a number of

ways we can solve this problem and we've seen some of this before if it's not important for

it to be centered right out of the gate on mobile well then the easiest way to solve this would be

to set a style of min height 100 viewport height units I close this we can see that in that case

it'll work just fine because now our wrapper is the entire height of the viewport but this solution

has that caveat which is on mobile devices the vh unit represents the maximum size of the viewport

and when you first load a page on mobile the address bar is bigger you can see the current

address there's usually a footer bar that contains the back button right as you scroll a page all that

stuff slides away and the viewport gets bigger that bigger size is what vh units target so when

you view this on a mobile device it's going to be sitting a little bit lower than you would expect

because the container is actually taller than the available space you're even going to get a scroll

bar so if that is a deal breaker for us we have to fall back to another solution and that other

solution involves setting percentage heights on all the containers and I've already explained this

so we're going to move pretty quickly I'm going to set height 100 on html and on body and then on

the wrapper I can change this to be a percentage and you'll see I have exactly the same result

on desktop because on desktop percentage and vh in this unit in this context are the same but you'll

notice if I remove this style let's maybe change it back to auto well then it falls back to the same

problem the reason for that is that this percentage sign right it's a percentage of its parents height

wrapper's parent is the body tag and body doesn't have a height so body is trying to figure out how

tall it should be based on its children and its child is saying it should be 100 of its parent

right there's this recursive thing happening so that doesn't work in order to get it to work we

have to set both the html tag and the body tag to be 100% and the reason this works is that html

doesn't have a parent right that's the very top and so it has no choice but to fall back to the

viewport height this little curiosity aside hopefully these two properties together make

you kind of breathe a sigh of relief because it becomes so much easier to do vertical centering

than it used to be back when we used to have to come up with all kinds of clever hacks to do it

and that's that's our solution
