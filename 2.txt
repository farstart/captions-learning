so hopefully you remember if we think all the way back to module one that we talked about the

cardinality in flow layout where you have a block direction and an inline direction and block elements

and inline elements and each direction carried its own set of rules so for example a block element

would be stacked in the block direction and it would be greedy in the inline direction so a block

element would expand to fill the available horizontal space whereas an inline element

would be placed along the inline direction but would be very very lackadaisical and very go with

the flow right water off a duck's back flexbox has the same kind of idea in terms of having two

different directions but the big twist that flexbox brings is that you can flip what those directions

are for every given container they're nowhere near as locked in as they are with flow layout

so i can show you what i mean here i have a container that holds four items and the only

css i've applied is i've put display flex on the container and then i've also given the container

a fixed size so it has a fixed height and width and what we can notice is that the items are all

stacked right up at the front which immediately is a little bit strange for block level elements

but then they're also stretched for the available horizontal space and i'm going to toggle on so we

can see the labels in this case because this is a flex direction row which is the default value

items will be placed along the horizontal axis they're going to be placed in a single row

is how you read that and they're all kind of sitting right up at the front of that axis right

they're at the left edge of the container and since this is the primary axis it's the front

of this axis meanwhile in the cross axis they're kind of stretched across the axis and the cool

thing about this is i can flip the direction so if i now set flex direction column and make our

container a little bit bigger we can see that the same rules apply except now our axes have been

rotated so they're still at the front of the primary axis right the top of the container

and they're still being stretched across the cross axis and this is really there's a really nice

symmetry with this where for almost everything if you learn how to do something in one direction you

can apply that knowledge to do it in the other direction which is really really cool and i think

one of the undervalued aspects of flexbox this behavior where it stretches across the cross

axis and sits at the front of the primary axis is configurable so i have another one of these

little demo units but now i have a couple other controls and i will warn you now it takes forever

to remember which is which between justify content and align items they didn't do a great job naming

them but it will eventually stick with enough practice so these are the default values justify

content flex start align items stretch and justify content is for the primary axis align items is for

the cross axis or secondary axis i can change flex start to flex end and notice now that things

move to the end of the primary axis you might wonder like why call it flex start and flex why

not just left and right and the reason is that again it's the same rules when you rotate so when

i'm in this vertical configuration flex end would be the bottom flex start would be the top right

because things move from top to bottom and from left to right in their respective axes when it

comes to aligning items i can also use flex start and flex end and you'll notice they function kind

of the same way so if i set flex end to both of them i'm at the bottom of the primary axis and

the right of the cross axis right i'm as far away from these labels as i can get you'll also notice

that the values they hold aren't the same so they share these three they share flex start flex end

and center which makes sense right i can center things in either direction or move them to the

left or right or top or bottom but then they each have their own different options so for example in

justify content we have this interesting value space between and the idea with space between

is that it pushes the items to be as far away from each other as possible to try and increase

the gap between them as much as it can so of course this is going to depend on the container

and if the container is too small then it won't have any effect right if i if the container is

too small none of these things have any effect because there just isn't enough space for them

but that's essentially how it works is it increases the space between the items if there

is leftover space now why isn't there an align items space between well it makes sense if you

think about it because in this given configuration i have multiple items that share the same like

position in terms of the primary axis right the primary axis is a row and i can draw a line through

that row that intersects all four items i can't do the same thing in the cross axis though right

like i can't draw a vertical line that cuts through multiple items so what on earth would

it mean to set align items space between there's only one item in every given column for example

now this isn't always true in a few lessons we're going to talk about wrapping in flexbox

but this is fundamentally why which is generally speaking you don't have that overlap in terms of

cross-direction axis and so it doesn't really make sense to be able to put space between things

similarly you might wonder why there's no justify content stretch and that's a great question and

one that we're going to explore a little bit later suffice it to say that there is a better

way to do what you might want to do with justify content stretch the last thing i want to touch on

is just these three options we have justify content space between space around is similar

and the way to imagine this is imagine you put like a block a box around each child and put

equal padding within that box on the left and right so each item kind of has this invisible box

and it's creating that even spacing what this means in practice is that there is twice as much

space between items as there is to the outer container this can be useful if you have like

a nav menu on mobile and you want to have three icons right that's kind of i think when i've used

this property before justify content space evenly is similar but with one slight difference which

is now the space between the edge of the container and the item is the same as the

space between items you have five equal chunks of space around the items the one last little

thing to note is that all of the properties we've seen so far exist in internet explorer

but justify content space evenly is the newest of the bunch and doesn't enjoy i.e. support so

if you do need to support i.e. i would stick with space around when it comes to baseline well

actually this is something that warrants its own little discussion and that is going to be

the subject of the next lesson
