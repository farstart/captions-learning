Well we've reached the halfway point in this workshop and given that there are only four exercises

that means that we are on the penultimate one now and the goal for this exercise is really to

to do all the window dressing to do all the trimming around our shoes themselves so we're

not going to touch anything within this grid but we are going to do the heading above it and we're

going to do this sidebar with the breadcrumbs and if we look at where we start with this one

we definitely have our work cut out for us in fact we don't even see that we have a sidebar

but indeed if we scroll down far enough we do see that this part actually seems pretty good it's

just in the wrong spot in order to figure out where we have to do our work like where all these

components live we can use the dev tools so i'll just grab one of these components and we'll make

this a bit bigger it seems like i have these two columns main column and left column and they're

both defined inside a file called shoe index so handily enough i have that file open and we can

see exactly what we were just looking at which is i have this main column that has my header with

title and filter the grid itself and then i have the left column with breadcrumbs and with a shoe

sidebar and as has become tradition at this point we're going to start by saying display flex

when i do that we do get the right general idea except our sidebar is on the wrong side

and i'm sure for many folks the instinct is to go and just move it so that i mean it even kind

of makes sense right the left column should be on the left and so it should come before

something that would be on the right and if i do this it does solve this problem but it introduces

a subtle usability issue which has to do with tab order right like if i'm tabbing through these

items we can imagine i'm specifically looking at running shoes i want to see the running shoes and

i want to see them before i have to navigate through 15 different links to different categories

that i probably don't care about so this is granted something that we could debate like maybe

that is the desired behavior in some cases but in this case i feel pretty confident to show me the

shoes and let the person navigate to other categories if none of these shoes speak to them

um okay so now let's go and figure out how to do that we could use the order property right make

the order of this one too or actually let me move it back so that it's in the right spot make the

order of this one to the order of this one one but rather than do that i would rather say that

we should tweak the flex direction and instead of having it be row we'll have it be row reverse

when i do this we are left with one little curious thing which is there's all this awkward space

over here the reason for that is that flex direction row reverse flips the direction of

start and end right so flex start is now on the right side and flex end is on the left side and

in a row or really in both flex directions things try to stack near the start so in order to solve

this we could maybe use justify content space between and just kind of push them but i actually

i want this column to grow so let's do that let's go to our main column and we will say flex one

and when i do that we can see just from the filter here this one grows of course it grows

a little bit too much we're going to have to figure something for that out but first i want

to address something which just to make our lives easier you'll notice if i make the window

smaller than 800 pixels or even really like if i make it of any size with my current resolution

the sidebar gets pushed way off the page the annoying thing about this is it's not a real

problem and what i mean by that is that when we deal with the shoe grid this problem will go away

the trouble is that the we have these giant images and because we haven't given them an explicit

permission to shrink they won't shrink they have their min content which is enormous

and they're blocking all of our progress so i think rather than deal with like let's do half

of the shoe grid now and half later let's just remove the shoe grid so i have this component

and just like that we can remove it and now wind up with much more predictable much nicer behavior

of course not permanent right we do want to have a shoe grid but that'll make our life easier for

now and i want to solve the fact that there's this zero space between the two and if we look

at our design we do see that there is kind of a prescribed width for this sidebar so 248 pixels

and then there's also an additional gap of 32 pixels so we'll deal with both of those things

we will say that our left column should have a width of actually let's use flex basis of 248

pixels i could also change this to min width if i really wanted this to be a firm number

but i tend to do that later if needed we'll see if it comes to that in the meantime i'll say that

it has a flex basis of 248 and if i needed to support internet explorer and depending on when

you watch this safari i would then add a margin right of 32 pixels because i'm building this in

kind of a forward looking way and by the time you watch this it really may not be necessary

i'm going to say that this should instead be a gap so that between our two columns

there will be a gap of 32 pixels when i do that things are starting to look pretty good

we can verify that all of our numbers are right we do see that with this we have a width of 248

pixels and we can kind of just measure that there is this gap of 32 pixels okay what's next well we

have a subtle detail that is super important and really contributes to this feeling like

a professional design is baseline alignment and it's kind of cool that we can actually draw let

me make this a little bit bigger we can kind of draw a straight line that runs along the baseline

of every bit of text in this line from the breadcrumbs on the left to the filter select

input on the right and that may seem pretty tricky especially because if we think about how

it's structured right we have a left column over here and then we have a main column over here so

these elements don't share they're not just all arranged in one row so how do we do this

well it turns out that align items baseline is honestly pretty magical and we'll see how

exactly that works let's put it way at the top right so we have this wrapper that houses both

of our columns let's say align items baseline when i do that you'll notice the heading over

here gets pulled up so now even though these are in two different siblings and both of these

containers have a whole bunch of stuff it happens to align them because they're both at the top of

their container and baseline alignment is really kind of smart and can usually intuit what you're

trying to do of course we're not there yet because we have this sort which is all being arranged top

bottom right now so let's pop into our let's see what it is we have this header element that has

two children and we're going to have to put them into a flex container so we will say display flex

when i do that we're left with what appears to be a horrible mess

just because we have this what i presume is a label that exists beside our filter so let's

go look at how that works and this select component is very similar to the one we built in module three

but it does have this additional bit of let me make it a single does have this additional

does have one additional element which is this visible label section and right now visible label

and select wrapper exist within this wrapper so once again for the third time this exercise

let's add display flex so when i do that we've definitely moved a step in the right direction

we now have our label which is beside our input our select but they're not sharing baseline

alignment so let's add that as well we will say align items baseline

and now we have one more baseline problem which is that these two elements are sharing a baseline

and these two elements are sharing a baseline but they aren't sharing the same baseline so once

again for the last time we'll go back to shoe index and we will say on our header align items

baseline and with that you'll notice it moves these two down and now at long last we have

a single cohesive baseline for all of these elements it is just pretty darn cool that we

can do this right baselines can be used recursively like this nested the only thing that i see left to

do is the fact that running sort is not a single word here we should have these two items be as

far from each other as possible so let's go back into our header and we will add that the justify

content should be space between and with that we will see that as this window grows and shrinks

the most space all of the leftover space is kept between these two

and i think that this looks pretty darn good
