So for this one we have to build a pretty common layout with a sidebar and some main content and

happily we're given a bunch of the information that we need. The first constraint is that our

nav should be a third of the total size so I'm going to give this a flex of one and this one's

going to get a flex of two because when we add two and one we get three total units and we want

this to have one of those three units but we also want to give it some constraints. So we want to

say that the nav has a max width of 150 pixels whilst meanwhile our main has a maximum of 500

pixels. When I do that things look pretty decent but we're still kind of glued to the left edge

of our window so let's also mix in a bit of justify content center and with those constraints in the

bag we have what looks to me like a pretty good layout and a completed exercise.
