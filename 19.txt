So in this exercise, we're asked to build a superheader, and we're given all of the

markup that we need, but none of the styles. So looking at this, we can kind of plot our journey,

which is that we're going to want to use flexbox, and we're going to want these two items to be

moved to the far end. This text can stay where it is. So let's get started. We're going to add

style for our header, and we're going to say display flex. When I do that, something a little

unfortunate happens, which is that it automatically prunes out the naturally occurring white space

between these inline elements. And actually, I kind of want that space, so let's re-add it,

in effect, with the gap property, and I'll give it a gap of eight pixels. Next, I want to move

these two items to the right, and there is like a little bit of a wrench thrown in our gears here,

which is, in the example above, we did this by grabbing the first item and setting its margin

right to auto. We can't really do the same thing here, though, because the first item is a text

node, and we can't give a text node styles, but we can accomplish the same goal by using margin left

on the second item. So I'm going to grab our label, and I'm going to say margin left auto.

And when I do this, you'll see that it does move these two items to the right, and the reason is

that, you know, this item's margin left occupies the exact same space that this item's margin right

would, so it ultimately has the same effect of just causing this margin

area to grow to fill the available space.
