So this is kind of an interesting one, because it's not really how we typically think about

centering, right? Typically we imagine centering a narrow item inside a wider container.

How do we center something that's bigger than the container itself? Well, the trick that we typically

might use to center an item, right, which is auto margin, unfortunately that doesn't quite work.

It works when the item can fit, like it works at this size, but then it just stays left aligned

when it's too big to fit. Happily though, Flexbox kind of gives you this for free. So if we go to

the wrapper and we'll put display flex on it, we'll make sure that it is a column, because our items

are stacked vertically. Then if I say align items center, we kind of just get that behavior just

like that, right? It works when it's smaller than the container, but it keeps working even when it's

bigger. Of course, in this example, we've also centered our paragraph and every child, so we

can borrow a trick that we saw in the very previous recipe and use align self.

That way we're centering this cat photo and any other items that want to share this behavior

without subjecting all children to the centering.
