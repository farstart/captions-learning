So with our super header in the bag we continue our trek onwards and our next stop is the regular

header, the primary header, and at first glance this might seem to be a little bit more straightforward

even right there's less elements that we have to worry about but it's actually a pretty tricky

thing and it's tricky because of our navigation which sits right in the middle of our page right

I can check and see that it's the same distance from either end well off by one but that's just

rounding and this is a really tricky thing because we have an asymmetry around it right we have the

logo on the left side and absolutely nothing over here on the right and I've seen so many very crafty

solutions around this right making the logo position absolute but then you have all these

other trade-offs like if the window gets too small they're going to wind up overlapping because

absolutely positioned elements aren't in flow there is a way to do this with flexbox but it

requires a little bit of lateral thinking specifically instead of trying to center the

navigation we have to think more in terms of consuming all the space and squeezing the

navigation into the center incidentally so I'll show you what I mean by that and let's start by

looking at some code so inside our main header we have our logo and our nav and I want to consume

all of the space and split it evenly between both ends I want to have like a column on the left a

column on the right and both of those columns are going to greedily push the nav towards the

middle so we're going to start by adding a side element just call it side and we're also going

to wrap logo inside now we could add some styles to logo but just for in terms of css reusability

it seems nicest to do it this way so I'm going to create a new element called side

we'll make it a div because it doesn't have any particular semantic meaning

and actually first I have to set the container to be flexbox then I want to have my sides be

greedy so we'll do this with flex one and when I do that funnily enough our navigation appears to

be perfectly centered right like I can measure it and see we have 413 pixels on this side and

412 which again rounding so that's it but why does this work why is it doing this well we can

inspect it with the dev tools and see and what we'll discover is we have a side element over here

taking up 258 pixels and a side over here taking up 258 we have to remember how flex one works it

sets flex grow to one but it sets flex basis to zero what that means is that it sets the hypothetical

size of both sides to zero and you know for the right side that's no problem because it's empty

but the left side has stuff in it so it shrinks that to zero and then it looks and sees how much

free space is there and the free space is everything other than this navigation

and it consumes all of that free space and then it distributes it based on flex grow

and because both of these have the same number they're both one it distributes all that extra

space evenly so you have two columns on either end that are both distributing all the space

and the nav has no choice but to sit in the middle because if there's a left side and a

right side that are both equal in size and not only equal but taking up all the space it forces

it into that position so this is a really neat trick one that i haven't seen used too much

but hopefully that can become a dependable part of your toolbox what's next what do we want to do

so i notice now that this is very much too short we want it to be taller let's go see exactly how

tall and it looks like it is a 72 pixel tall header so we'll just add that as height

with that done it exposes a bit of an alignment issue and in fact we already had an alignment

issue in terms of the text baseline right like we want our navigation to share a baseline with

our logo that's the way it would be if you wrote it on a page so let's solve that let's take a look

and see how to do that we can do that with just align items baseline so with that done we have

this very nice baseline text right like we can draw a nice line and it'll be just like as if we

were writing it on paper but now we have to figure out how to center this entire item within its

parent column honestly this is kind of a tricky thing because normally we could use line height

but that has its own trade-offs and the alternative is to use a separate container for this which

ultimately makes things quite a bit more complicated because we already have so many flex containers

so i'm going to do something a little bit hacky but honestly i think given the trade-offs it makes

sense and that hacky solution is to use padding to kind of pseudo center it so the way that i'm

going to do that is i'm going to come on to this main header over here and i'm going to say that

it should have 20 pixels of top padding and bottom padding too why not um if we look at that now the

whole thing moves down and that number doesn't look exactly right to me so maybe let's try 18

the fact that we have to kind of guess numbers in order for it to be centered might seem like a

bug but i actually think that's a bit of a feature because ultimately we don't need it

to be mathematically centered we need it to be optically centered and in fact if we look at the

design if we pay very very close attention what we'll notice is that we're not actually perfectly

aligned anyway we want it to be very slightly disaligned or unaligned so that it looks right

to our eye so even though this is kind of a weird pattern it works fine right like even if you zoom

in and out it doesn't break anything everything scales accordingly and it gives you really fine

grained control to make sure that it looks exactly right it's not the right solution in every case

right if the content is dynamic and you don't know how tall it's going to be then that won't work

you're going to have to use something like a flex column to center it but in this case i think it

solves the problem just fine next in our set of problems is the fact that all of our navigation

items are all squashed together right like i don't want i want them to have a bit of breathing room

and we can check in the design it looks like it keeps them 48 pixels apart so in our nav i'm going

to start by setting this to display flex and then i'm going to say that the gap inside should be 48

pixels when i do that it actually seems to work all right but it exposes another issue which is

i want some space inside here right like even though like right now it's working as intended

which is this space is equal to this space when the window gets small i don't want to let them get

that close together i want there to be a buffer there and the way that i'm going to do that is

i'm going to say that the navigation unit should have a margin of zero pixels 48 pixels so no top

bottom margin but an equal amount of left and right margin which matches the gap when i do that

it ensures that this space is not going to be collapsible and still make sure that it's centered

when there is enough space and with that i think that we can give ourselves a check mark on this

one and move on to the next part of the workshop
