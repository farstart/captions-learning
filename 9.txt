So it's become a bit of a theme in this module, but we're going to start by creating a flex container,

and it's going to be on the section because we want the nav and main to sit side by side.

So I'm going to say that the section has display flex.

Next, we have to think about, like, which one do we want to expand?

And our main content is the one that should grow to fill any excess space.

So we'll add that with flex grow one.

That solves that problem.

The last thing that we have to do is if we notice in this GIF, once we reach the point that our main item reaches its hypothetical size,

we want the other nav to be the one that shrinks.

And technically speaking, they're both going to shrink.

But we want nav to shrink at such an accelerated rate that it appears that main is not shrinking.

So we can do that by adding a new property to nav of flex shrink.

And we can just pick, you know, a very big number like a million.

So then what happens is once we hit this point, which is the hypothetical size for main,

well, they're both going to shrink. But like I said, nav is going to shrink a million times faster.

So for every million pixels that this one shrinks by, this one's going to shrink by one.

So, you know, it's tiny, tiny fractions. It's not noticeable.

This one doesn't appear to be shrinking at all.

And that's going to continue until, boom, we reach the minimum size of our nav.

And then it has no choice. It has to take it.

Even though the shrink ratio is so out of whack, it has to take it for main

because there's no more shrinking possible on this side.

And that is our solution.
