So in this, the first exercise of the module, our goal is to reconstruct the placement of

these buttons inside this dialog. And we're given a fair bit, we have all the UI and there's a bunch

of styles that exist in the CSS tab. Now you're not expected to modify any of these, but if you

want to check them out, it could be helpful. But really our goal is just to figure out how to place

these buttons so that OK moves to the other end whilst cancel stays where it is. And I see that

those two buttons are sitting inside a footer with a class of actions. So that seems like as

good a place as any. Let's add a new selector. And if I just add display flex to that, we'll see that

not much changes. We do truncate out the little bit of space between them, and that's something

we will talk about later. But in this case, I want to align them along the primary axis, right?

Because they don't specify a flex direction, it defaults to row, which is a single row horizontally.

And indeed, that's what I want here. I don't want the buttons on top of each other.

So the direction is right. Now it's just about aligning things along that axis. And in this case,

space between is what I want, because I don't want there to be any space on the edge. If I did,

I could say space around, for example. Some dialogues might look like this. Some others

might even have them both in the center. But in this case, space between is what I want.
