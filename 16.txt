So in the English language we have the word items and we have the word content and honestly in most

situations I feel like you can use these words interchangeably, at least to me they seem like

synonyms, but in the world of Flexbox they have very different definitions indeed. And we can

illustrate this by looking at one of these early Flexbox demo units and noticing that justify

content has kind of two parts right there's justify which has to do with the primary axis

nature of the alignment and then there's content and in this case the content refers to the fact

that we are positioning a group of items with justify content you can take these four items

and move them all to the center or all to the start or you can like split them up and have

space between them right you're positioning things not as individual units but as a cohesive group

whereas align items right align refers to the fact that it's the cross axis but items refers

to the fact that every item is being positioned kind of on its own even though we're positioning

all four items they're all being managed individually I don't have to worry about

spacing between them it's just all the items should go at the start or they should stretch

whatever it is and this has interesting implications when we start talking about

line wrapping because when you have flex wrap all of a sudden in our cross axis direction we

have multiple items right so what does it mean to take an item and align it in the center well we

can try it we can take a line items and say center and you'll notice that each item moves within the

context of its own row right like this item over here can move from this would be the start and

this would be the end but what if we want to move the whole group in the same way that justify

content moves the whole group well for that we have a line content and as you can see I can say

center and then they all come to the center I can say stretch in which case they all kind of move

apart from each other it's all of the same principles from justify content but applied

to the cross axis these two properties kind of live harmoniously together because they both do

slightly different things now I'll be honest I don't really use align content super often

at least not in flexbox but we're going to see it again when we look at css grid and honestly I

think it's worth learning just to help us clarify the difference between justify content and align

items and understand why they chose different words there
