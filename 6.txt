Okay so this is a fun challenge and I think it's interesting because there's a number of ways that

we could solve it and I don't think there is like a right answer but I do think that we can come up

with something that feels pretty darn good. So just to revisit what our problem is we have these

three items that are currently being aligned based on their baseline so that the bottoms of all this

text lines up and they're sitting within a container that has extra vertical space and we

want to center these items as a group within that space. So the way that I've solved this for a long

time my go-to method for this is to use line height and line height is a little interesting

we're going to talk about it more in our typography module but when you add a line height if I make it

like let's just say really something outrageously big it's going to center that text within that

space right if the line height is really big the text is always going to be centered within it

so if we set our line height to equal the height of our container we kind of get the centering for

free and we're centering the h1 which is the tallest item in our list which means that the

other items are going to pick their placement based on the baseline of that first item. So this

works but it does feel a little inelegant partially because when you select the text you can see that

like your selection is this enormous box it also doesn't do us any favors if we happen to have

multiple lines so if this became Tommy's barbecue well now each line is the full height of the

container. So let's scrap that and let's take a step back and think about how else we could do

this because we have this ul which is currently not super tall and it exists within a nav so what

if we make the nav a flex container as well so I'm going to say display flex and of course it's

going to default us to a row which isn't what we want let's make it a direction column this

kind of resets us to where we were but now we can align stuff within that so I'm going to say

justify content center and I'm using justify content because we've set a column here right so

our primary axis is the vertical one and that's the axis I want to center along now I recognize

that if you're not used to thinking about flexbox in this way it can be a little strange to see

nested flex boxes like this right we have a flex box on the nav and on the ul but they both serve

different purposes our ul's job is to figure out the horizontal placement right spacing items

with even spacing and then also to do the baseline alignment but then this whole group

is going to be vertically centered using the parent flex box there is one last thing I want

to talk about and it is out of scope for this module so if you'd like feel free to skip this

we'll come back to it later but I feel like it must be pointed out because I know that some folks

will be bothered by it and it's the fact that even though this is centered technically speaking

right if I select the text you can see that this space appears to be equal to this space

when I don't have it selected it doesn't actually feel centered it feels like it's too low

and part of that is because these items over here are being aligned to this one's baseline

which means that this space up here is way bigger than the space down here it also is a matter of

the fact that typography in general leaves more vertical space like this space is bigger than this

space so even though this is mathematically centered it is perfectly fitted doesn't look

right and optical alignment is the idea that we sometimes have to cheat a little bit and pull

something out of an actual aligned a mathematical alignment so that it looks right to our eyes

the way that I'm going to do this here is I'm going to use negative margin so on my ul I'm

going to say margin top and just kind of pick negative numbers and see how they feel right

minus four maybe minus eight that feels all right maybe a little bit too much right if I make it

minus 20 then it's going to be way too much maybe minus six is the right number in this case and

there really is no formula for this right I suppose maybe you could like try to figure out

what you want to anchor to and maybe this distance needs to be the same as this distance

but really it's just about trying numbers and trusting your intuition and just looking at it

and seeing if it feels right or not we're going to talk much more about that in the future

ultimately the goal for this little exercise is to talk about nesting flex boxes and how to

think in terms of two dimensions even with xbox
